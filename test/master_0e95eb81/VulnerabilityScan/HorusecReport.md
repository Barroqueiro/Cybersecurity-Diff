### Problem:  

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of ```\```r and ```\```n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.

## Critical Vulnerability 6
### Problem:  

The package handlebars before 4.7.7 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution when selecting certain compiling options to compile templates coming from an untrusted source.
         
### Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution. Templates may alter an Objects&#39; `__proto__` and `__defineGetter__` properties, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted payloads.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.3.0 or later.
         
### Problem:  

The package handlebars before 4.7.7 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when selecting certain compiling options to compile templates coming from an untrusted source.
         
### Problem:  

Handlebars before 4.4.5 allows Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) because of eager matching. The parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing crafted templates. This may allow attackers to exhaust system resources.
         
### Problem:  

Handlebars before 3.0.8 and 4.x before 4.5.3 is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript. This can be used to run arbitrary code on a server processing Handlebars templates or in a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as XSS).
         
### Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.3 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package&#39;s lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the system. It is due to an incomplete fix for a [previous issue](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1316). This vulnerability can be used to run arbitrary code in a server processing Handlebars templates or on a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as Cross-Site Scripting).


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.3 or later.
         
### Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.2 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package&#39;s lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the system. It can be used to run arbitrary code in a server processing Handlebars templates or on a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as Cross-Site Scripting).

The following template can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability:  

```
{{#with &#34;constructor&#34;}}
	{{#with split as |a|}}
		{{pop (push &#34;alert(&#39;Vulnerable Handlebars JS&#39;);&#34;)}}
		{{#with (concat (lookup join (slice 0 1)))}}
			{{#each (slice 2 3)}}
				{{#with (apply 0 a)}}
					{{.}}
				{{/with}}
			{{/each}}
		{{/with}}
	{{/with}}
{{/with}}
```



## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.2 or later.
         
### Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.3 are vulnerable to prototype pollution. It is possible to add or modify properties to the Object prototype through a malicious template. This may allow attackers to crash the application or execute Arbitrary Code in specific conditions.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.3 or later.
         
### Problem:  

Affected versions of `handlebars` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The package&#39;s parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing specially-crafted templates. This may allow attackers to exhaust system resources leading to Denial of Service.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 4.4.5 or later.

## Critical Vulnerability 7
### Problem:  

Minimist &lt;=1.2.5 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via file index.js, function setKey() (lines 69-95).
         
### Problem:  

Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.  
This is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.



## Recommendation

Upgrade to versions 0.2.1, 1.2.3 or later.

## Instances

[Instances](#critical-vulnerability-7-instances)

## Critical Vulnerability 8
### Problem:  

Versions of `set-value` prior to 3.0.1 or 2.0.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `set` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.




## Recommendation

If you are using `set-value` 3.x, upgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.
If you are using `set-value` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.
         
### Problem:  

This affects the package `set-value` before 2.0.1, and starting with 3.0.0 but prior to 4.0.1. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2019-10747 when the user-provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays.

## Critical Vulnerability 9
### Problem:  

Versions of `mixin-deep` prior to 2.0.1 or 1.3.2 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `mixinDeep` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.




## Recommendation

If you are using `mixin-deep` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.
If you are using `mixin-deep` 1.x, upgrade to version 1.3.2 or later.

## Instances

## Critical Vulnerability 10
### Problem:  

Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.  The function `defaultsDeep` allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.




## Recommendation

Update to version 4.17.12 or later.
         
### Problem:  

Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function zipObjectDeep allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires zipping objects based on user-provided property arrays.

This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.
         
### Problem:  

`lodash` versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.
         
### Problem:  

All versions of package lodash prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the toNumber, trim and trimEnd functions. Steps to reproduce (provided by reporter Liyuan Chen): var lo = require(&#39;lodash&#39;); function build_blank (n) { var ret = &#34;1&#34; for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) { ret += &#34; &#34; } return ret + &#34;1&#34;; } var s = build_blank(50000) var time0 = Date.now(); lo.trim(s) var time_cost0 = Date.now() - time0; console.log(&#34;time_cost0: &#34; + time_cost0) var time1 = Date.now(); lo.toNumber(s) var time_cost1 = Date.now() - time1; console.log(&#34;time_cost1: &#34; + time_cost1) var time2 = Date.now(); lo.trimEnd(s) var time_cost2 = Date.now() - time2; console.log(&#34;time_cost2: &#34; + time_cost2)

NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.

### Problem:  

### Impact
Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 &#34;short path&#34; counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.

### Patches

6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.


```
js
const tar = require(&#39;tar&#39;)

tar.x({
  file: &#39;archive.tgz&#39;,
  filter: (file, entry) =&gt; {
    if (entry.type === &#39;SymbolicLink&#39;) {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})

```


Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

#### Fix

The problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:

1. The `String.normalize(&#39;NFKD&#39;)` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.
2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, ````\```` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).
3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.

         
### Problem:  

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both ````\```` and `/` characters as path separators, however ````\```` is a valid filename character on posix systems.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. 

These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.

The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.

    }
  }
})

```


Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

### Fix

The problem is addressed in the following ways:

1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing ````\```` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving ````\```` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.
2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.

#### Caveat

Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar&#39;s API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.

Users are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.
         
### Problem:  

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. 

This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. 

### Patches

3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1

NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.


```
js
const path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
const tar = require(&#39;tar&#39;)

tar.x({
  file: &#39;archive.tgz&#39;,
  // either add this function...
  onentry: (entry) =&gt; {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)
      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)
    }
  },

  // or this one
  filter: (file, entry) =&gt; {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})

```

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks.  Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

### Problem:  

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.

This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some```\```path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:```\```extraction```\```dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.

Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.

This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.

### Patches

4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9

### Workarounds

There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

### Fix

The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not &#34;absolute&#34;.

Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.

Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.

Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender&#39;s / receiver&#39;s identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity&#39;s receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender&#39;s identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
### Problem:  

Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.. For more information checkout the CWE-829 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html) advisory.

### Problem:  

Debugger statements should not be used
The debugger statement can be placed anywhere in procedures to suspend execution. Using the debugger statement is similar to setting a breakpoint in the code. By definition such statement must absolutely be removed from the source code to prevent any unexpected behavior or added vulnerability to attacks in production. For more information checkout the CWE-489 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/489.html) advisory.

In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.

### Problem:  

PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.

### Problem:  

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

### Problem:  

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

### Problem:  

Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.  
This is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.

### Patches
This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.

### Workarounds
To workaround the issue without upgrading, adding the following to your code:


```
js
jQuery.htmlPrefilter = function( html ) {
	return html;
};

```


You need to use at least jQuery 1.12/2.2 or newer to be able to apply this workaround.

Problem:  

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For EPS data, the readline implementation used in EPSImageFile has to deal with any combination of \r and \n as line endings. It used an accidentally quadratic method of accumulating lines while looking for a line ending. A malicious EPS file could use this to perform a DoS of Pillow in the open phase, before an image was accepted for opening.

Problem:  

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. PSDImagePlugin.PsdImageFile lacked a sanity check on the number of input layers relative to the size of the data block. This could lead to a DoS on Image.open prior to Image.load.

Problem:  

An issue was discovered in Pillow before 8.2.0. For BLP data, BlpImagePlugin did not properly check that reads (after jumping to file offsets) returned data. This could lead to a DoS where the decoder could be run a large number of times on empty data.

The package handlebars before 4.7.7 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution when selecting certain compiling options to compile templates coming from an untrusted source.
         
Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.3.0 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution leading to Remote Code Execution. Templates may alter an Objects&#39; `__proto__` and `__defineGetter__` properties, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code through crafted payloads.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.3.0 or later.
         
Problem:  

The package handlebars before 4.7.7 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE) when selecting certain compiling options to compile templates coming from an untrusted source.
         
Problem:  

Handlebars before 4.4.5 allows Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) because of eager matching. The parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing crafted templates. This may allow attackers to exhaust system resources.
         
Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.3 are vulnerable to prototype pollution. It is possible to add or modify properties to the Object prototype through a malicious template. This may allow attackers to crash the application or execute Arbitrary Code in specific conditions.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.3 or later.
         
Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.3 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package&#39;s lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the system. It is due to an incomplete fix for a [previous issue](https://www.npmjs.com/advisories/1316). This vulnerability can be used to run arbitrary code in a server processing Handlebars templates or on a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as Cross-Site Scripting).


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.3 or later.
         
Problem:  

Handlebars before 3.0.8 and 4.x before 4.5.3 is vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript. This can be used to run arbitrary code on a server processing Handlebars templates or in a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as XSS).
         
Problem:  

Versions of `handlebars` prior to 3.0.8 or 4.5.2 are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package&#39;s lookup helper fails to properly validate templates, allowing attackers to submit templates that execute arbitrary JavaScript in the system. It can be used to run arbitrary code in a server processing Handlebars templates or on a victim&#39;s browser (effectively serving as Cross-Site Scripting).

The following template can be used to demonstrate the vulnerability:  
```{{#with &#34;constructor&#34;}}
	{{#with split as |a|}}
		{{pop (push &#34;alert(&#39;Vulnerable Handlebars JS&#39;);&#34;)}}
		{{#with (concat (lookup join (slice 0 1)))}}
			{{#each (slice 2 3)}}
				{{#with (apply 0 a)}}
					{{.}}
				{{/with}}
			{{/each}}
		{{/with}}
	{{/with}}
{{/with}}```


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 3.0.8, 4.5.2 or later.
         
Problem:  

Affected versions of `handlebars` are vulnerable to Denial of Service. The package&#39;s parser may be forced into an endless loop while processing specially-crafted templates. This may allow attackers to exhaust system resources leading to Denial of Service.


## Recommendation

Upgrade to version 4.4.5 or later.</td>

Versions of `lodash` before 4.17.12 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.  The function `defaultsDeep` allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of `Object` via `{constructor: {prototype: {...}}}` causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.




## Recommendation

Update to version 4.17.12 or later.
         
Problem:  

`lodash` versions prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Command Injection via the template function.
         
Problem:  

Versions of lodash prior to 4.17.19 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The function zipObjectDeep allows a malicious user to modify the prototype of Object if the property identifiers are user-supplied. Being affected by this issue requires zipping objects based on user-provided property arrays.

This vulnerability causes the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects and may lead to Denial of Service or Code Execution under specific circumstances.
         
Problem:  

All versions of package lodash prior to 4.17.21 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via the toNumber, trim and trimEnd functions. Steps to reproduce (provided by reporter Liyuan Chen): var lo = require(&#39;lodash&#39;); function build_blank (n) { var ret = &#34;1&#34; for (var i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) { ret += &#34; &#34; } return ret + &#34;1&#34;; } var s = build_blank(50000) var time0 = Date.now(); lo.trim(s) var time_cost0 = Date.now() - time0; console.log(&#34;time_cost0: &#34; + time_cost0) var time1 = Date.now(); lo.toNumber(s) var time_cost1 = Date.now() - time1; console.log(&#34;time_cost1: &#34; + time_cost1) var time2 = Date.now(); lo.trimEnd(s) var time_cost2 = Date.now() - time2; console.log(&#34;time_cost2: &#34; + time_cost2)</td>

Versions of `set-value` prior to 3.0.1 or 2.0.1 are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The `set` function fails to validate which Object properties it updates. This allows attackers to modify the prototype of Object, causing the addition or modification of an existing property on all objects.




## Recommendation

If you are using `set-value` 3.x, upgrade to version 3.0.1 or later.
If you are using `set-value` 2.x, upgrade to version 2.0.1 or later.
         
Problem:  

This affects the package `set-value` before 2.0.1, and starting with 3.0.0 but prior to 4.0.1. A type confusion vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2019-10747 when the user-provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays.</td>

Minimist &lt;=1.2.5 is vulnerable to Prototype Pollution via file index.js, function setKey() (lines 69-95).
         
Problem:  

Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.  
This is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.

      Running containers with &#39;root&#39; user can lead to a container escape situation. It is a best practice to run containers as non-root users, which can be done by adding a &#39;USER&#39; statement to the Dockerfile.
      Message: Specify at least 1 USER command in Dockerfile with non-root user as argument
      Resolution: Add &#39;USER &lt;non root user name&gt;&#39; line to the Dockerfile

Moment.js is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates. A path traversal vulnerability impacts npm (server) users of Moment.js between versions 1.0.1 and 2.29.1, especially if a user-provided locale string is directly used to switch moment locale. This problem is patched in 2.29.2, and the patch can be applied to all affected versions. As a workaround, sanitize the user-provided locale name before passing it to Moment.js.

This affects the package celery before 5.2.2. It by default trusts the messages and metadata stored in backends (result stores). When reading task metadata from the backend, the data is deserialized. Given that an attacker can gain access to, or somehow manipulate the metadata within a celery backend, they could trigger a stored command injection vulnerability and potentially gain further access to the system.

** DISPUTED ** Null Pointer Dereference vulnerability exists in numpy.sort in NumPy &amp;lt and 1.19 in the PyArray_DescrNew function due to missing return-value validation, which allows attackers to conduct DoS attacks by repetitively creating sort arrays. NOTE: While correct that validation is missing, an error can only occur due to an exhaustion of memory. If the user can exhaust memory, they are already privileged. Further, it should be practically impossible to construct an attack which can target the memory exhaustion to occur at exactly this place.

PySAML2 before 5.0.0 does not check that the signature in a SAML document is enveloped and thus signature wrapping is effective, i.e., it is affected by XML Signature Wrapping (XSW). The signature information and the node/object that is signed can be in different places and thus the signature verification will succeed, but the wrong data will be used. This specifically affects the verification of assertion that have been signed.

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory.

This logic was insufficient on Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`.  If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive, rather than the extraction target directory.

Additionally, a `..` portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.

This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems.

### Patches

4.4.18 || 5.0.10 || 6.1.9

### Workarounds

There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization procedures that node-tar now does.

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

### Fix

The fixed versions strip path roots from all paths prior to being resolved against the extraction target folder, even if such paths are not &#34;absolute&#34;.

Additionally, a path starting with a drive letter and then two dots, like `c:../`, would bypass the check for `..` path portions.  This is checked properly in the patched versions.

Finally, a defense in depth check is added, such that if the `entry.absolute` is outside of the extraction taret, and we are not in preservePaths:true mode, a warning is raised on that entry, and it is skipped.  Currently, it is believed that this check is redundant, but it did catch some oversights in development.

         
Problem:  

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. 

This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. 

### Patches

3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1

NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address CVE-2021-32803 as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

```js
const path = require(&#39;path&#39;)
const tar = require(&#39;tar&#39;)

tar.x({
  file: &#39;archive.tgz&#39;,
  // either add this function...
  onentry: (entry) =&gt; {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)
      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)
    }
  },

  // or this one
  filter: (file, entry) =&gt; {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.
         
Problem:  

### Impact
Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

node-tar aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained two directories and a symlink with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 &#34;short path&#34; counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include directories with two forms of the path that resolve to the same file system entity, followed by a symbolic link with a name in the first form, lastly followed by a file using the second form. It led to bypassing node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.

### Patches

6.1.9 || 5.0.10 || 4.4.18

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom filter method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.

```js
const tar = require(&#39;tar&#39;)

tar.x({
  file: &#39;archive.tgz&#39;,
  filter: (file, entry) =&gt; {
    if (entry.type === &#39;SymbolicLink&#39;) {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

#### Fix

The problem is addressed in the following ways, when comparing paths in the directory cache and path reservation systems:

1. The `String.normalize(&#39;NFKD&#39;)` method is used to first normalize all unicode to its maximally compatible and multi-code-point form.
2. All slashes are normalized to `/` on Windows systems (on posix systems, `\` is a valid filename character, and thus left intact).
3. When a symbolic link is encountered on Windows systems, the entire directory cache is cleared.  Collisions related to use of 8.3 short names to replace directories with other (non-symlink) types of entries may make archives fail to extract properly, but will not result in arbitrary file writes.

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/` characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename character on posix systems.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems.  If a tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem, but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.  A subsequent file entry within the `FOO` directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link, thinking that the directory had already been created. 

These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7.

The v3 branch of `node-tar` has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of `node-tar`. If this is not possible, a workaround is available below.

    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

### Fix

The problem is addressed in the following ways:

1. All paths are normalized to use `/` as a path separator, replacing `\` with `/` on Windows systems, and leaving `\` intact in the path on posix systems.  This is performed in depth, at every level of the program where paths are consumed.
2. Directory cache pruning is performed case-insensitively.  This _may_ result in undue cache misses on case-sensitive file systems, but the performance impact is negligible.

#### Caveat

Note that this means that the `entry` objects exposed in various parts of tar&#39;s API will now always use `/` as a path separator, even on Windows systems.  This is not expected to cause problems, as `/` is a valid path separator on Windows systems, but _may_ result in issues if `entry.path` is compared against a path string coming from some other API such as `fs.realpath()` or `path.resolve()`.

Users are encouraged to always normalize paths using a well-tested method such as `path.resolve()` before comparing paths to one another.

### Overview
The `ini` npm package before version 1.3.6 has a Prototype Pollution vulnerability.

If an attacker submits a malicious INI file to an application that parses it with `ini.parse`, they will pollute the prototype on the application. This can be exploited further depending on the context.

### Patches

This has been patched in 1.3.6

### Steps to reproduce

payload.ini
```
[__proto__]
polluted = &#34;polluted&#34;
```

poc.js:
```
var fs = require(&#39;fs&#39;)
var ini = require(&#39;ini&#39;)

var parsed = ini.parse(fs.readFileSync(&#39;./payload.ini&#39;, &#39;utf-8&#39;))
console.log(parsed)
console.log(parsed.__proto__)
console.log(polluted)
```

```
&gt; node poc.js

{ polluted: &#39;polluted&#39; }
{ polluted: &#39;polluted&#39; }

serialize-javascript prior to 3.1.0 allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary code via the function &#34;deleteFunctions&#34; within &#34;index.js&#34;. 

An object such as `{&#34;foo&#34;: /1&#34;/, &#34;bar&#34;: &#34;a\&#34;@__R-&lt;UID&gt;-0__@&#34;}` was serialized as `{&#34;foo&#34;: /1&#34;/, &#34;bar&#34;: &#34;a\/1&#34;/}`, which allows an attacker to escape the `bar` key. This requires the attacker to control the values of both `foo` and `bar` and guess the value of `&lt;UID&gt;`. The UID has a keyspace of approximately 4 billion making it a realistic network attack.
         
Problem:  

Versions of `serialize-javascript` prior to 2.1.1 are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package fails to sanitize serialized regular expressions. This vulnerability does not affect Node.js applications.

The Elliptic package before version 6.5.3 for Node.js allows ECDSA signature malleability via variations in encoding, leading &#39;\0&#39; bytes, or integer overflows. This could conceivably have a security-relevant impact if an application relied on a single canonical signature.
         
Problem:  

The npm package `elliptic` before version 6.5.4 are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues via the secp256k1 implementation in elliptic/ec/key.js. There is no check to confirm that the public key point passed into the derive function actually exists on the secp256k1 curve. This results in the potential for the private key used in this implementation to be revealed after a number of ECDH operations are performed.</td>

Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender&#39;s / receiver&#39;s identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity&#39;s receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender&#39;s identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties.

No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead.

Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender&#39;s / receiver&#39;s identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity&#39;s receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender&#39;s identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties.

Problem:  

No use weak random number generator
When software generates predictable values in a context requiring unpredictability, it may be possible for an attacker to guess the next value that will be generated, and use this guess to impersonate another user or access sensitive information. As the Math.random() function relies on a weak pseudorandom number generator, this function should not be used for security-critical applications or for protecting sensitive data. In such context, a cryptographically strong pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) should be used instead. For more information checkout the CWE-338 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/338.html) advisory.
         
Problem:  

Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system..

Origins should be verified during cross-origin communications
Browsers allow message exchanges between Window objects of different origins. Because any window can send / receive messages from other window it is important to verify the sender&#39;s / receiver&#39;s identity: When sending message with postMessage method, the identity&#39;s receiver should be defined (the wildcard keyword (*) should not be used).
When receiving message with message event, the sender&#39;s identity should be verified using the origin and possibly source properties. For more information checkout the OWASP A2:2017 (https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A2_2017-Broken_Authentication) and (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) advisory.
         
Problem:  

Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system.. For more information checkout the CWE-829 (https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/829.html) advisory.

Staff members could use the TemplateDetailView view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other words, there is directory traversal outside of the template root directories.

django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based on user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0, automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter` instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new `get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent validator if they are not able to upgrade.

A flaw was found in Django REST Framework versions before 3.12.0 and before 3.11.2. When using the browseable API viewer, Django REST Framework fails to properly escape certain strings that can come from user input. This allows a user who can control those strings to inject malicious &lt;script&gt; tags, leading to a cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

### Impact
_Pillow before 8.1.1 allows attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) because the reported size of a contained image is not properly checked for a BLP container, and thus an attempted memory allocation can be very large._### Patches
_An issue was discovered in Pillow before 6.2.0. When reading specially crafted invalid image files, the library can either allocate very large amounts of memory or take an extremely long period of time to process the image._### Workarounds

PyPDF2 is an open source python PDF library capable of splitting, merging, cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In versions prior to 1.27.5 an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop if the PyPDF2 if the code attempts to get the content stream. The reason is that the last while-loop in `ContentStream._readInlineImage` only terminates when it finds the `EI` token, but never actually checks if the stream has already ended. This issue has been resolved in version `1.27.5`. Users unable to upgrade should validate and PDFs prior to iterating over their content stream.

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be processed and such a document can trick pysaml2 with a wrapped signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

Problem:  

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard. PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents, but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only _x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

Affected versions of `yargs-parser` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--foo.__proto__.bar baz&#39;` adds a `bar` property with value `baz` to all objects. This is only exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `yargs-parser`.



## Recommendation

Upgrade to versions 13.1.2, 15.0.1, 18.1.1 or later.</td>

### Impact
Passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery&#39;s DOM manipulation methods (i.e. `.html()`, `.append()`, and others) may execute untrusted code.

### Patches
This problem is patched in jQuery 3.5.0.

### Workarounds
To workaround the issue without upgrading, adding the following to your code:

```js
jQuery.htmlPrefilter = function( html ) {
	return html;
};
```

You need to use at least jQuery 1.12/2.2 or newer to be able to apply this workaround.

Affected versions of `minimist` are vulnerable to prototype pollution. Arguments are not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to modify the prototype of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.  
Parsing the argument `--__proto__.y=Polluted` adds a `y` property with value `Polluted` to all objects. The argument `--__proto__=Polluted` raises and uncaught error and crashes the application.  
This is exploitable if attackers have control over the arguments being passed to `minimist`.



## Recommendation

Upgrade to versions 0.2.1, 1.2.3 or later.</td>

Insecure download of executable file
Downloading executables or other sensitive files over an unencrypted connection can leave a server open to man-in-the-middle attacks (MITM). Such an attack can allow an attacker to insert arbitrary content into the downloaded file, and in the worst case, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system..
